/*
Andrew was attempting a mathematics test where he needed to solve problems with factorials. One such problem had an answer which equaled 100! ,He wondered what would this number look like. He tried to calculate 100! On his scientific calculator but failed to get a correct answer. Can you write a code to help Andrew calculate factorials of such large numbers?

Input Format
a single lined integer N

Constraints
1 < = N < = 500

Output Format
Print the factorial of N

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
120
Explanation
for factorial of 5 we have 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Logic:-
Create an array �res[ ]� of MAX size where MAX is number of maximum digits in output.
Initialize value stored in �res[ ]� as 1 and initialize �res_size� (size of �res[ ]�) as 1.
Do following for all numbers from x = 2 to n��

a) Multiply x with res[ ] and update res[ ] and res_size to store the multiplication result.

multiply(res[ ], x)

Initialize carry as 0.
Do following for i = 0 to res_size � 1 �..

a) Find value of res[i] * x + carry. Let this value be prod.

b) Update res[i] by storing last digit of prod in it.

c) Update carry by storing remaining digits in carrying.

Put all digits of carry in res[ ] and increase res_size by number of digits in carry Below is the Cpp code for the above logic
*/
#include < iostream >
using namespace std;

#define MAX 2000

int multiply(int x, int res[], int res_size);

void factorial(int n) { int res[MAX];

res[0] = 1;
int res_size = 1;

for (int x=2; x<=n; x++)
{
    res_size = multiply(x, res, res_size);
}

//cout << "Factorial of given number is \n";
for (int i=res_size-1; i>=0; i--)
    cout << res[i];
}

int multiply(int x, int res[], int res_size) { int carry = 0;

for (int i=0; i<res_size; i++)
{
    int prod = res[i] * x + carry;
    res[i] = prod % 10;
    carry  = prod/10;
}

while (carry)
{
    res[res_size] = carry%10;
    carry = carry/10;
    res_size++;
}
return res_size;
}

int main() { int n; cin>>n; factorial(n); return 0; }
