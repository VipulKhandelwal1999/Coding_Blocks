/*
You are provided n numbers (both +ve and -ve). Numbers are arranged in a circular form. You need to find the maximum sum of consecutive numbers.

Input Format
First line contains integer t which is number of test case.
For each test case, it contains an integer n which is the size of array and next line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=1000
|Ai| <= 10000

Output Format
Print the maximum circular sum for each testcase in a new line.

Sample Input
1
7
8 -8 9 -9 10 -11 12
Sample Output
22
Explanation
Maximum Circular Sum = 22 (12 + 8 - 8 + 9 - 9 + 10)

Logic:-
This Question can be done using the brute force viz, by using two nested loops and checking the sum of every possible subset but this approach is in O(n^2). So, Now we are going to discuss an approach which solves the given problem in O(n).

Approach :
For finding the Maximum Contiguous sum we are using the kadane's algorithm. But in the question the array is circular that means the maximum sum can be of elements which are a part of the wrapping or not. So,
There can be two cases for the maximum sum:
Case 1: The elements that contribute to the maximum sum are arranged such that no wrapping is there. Examples: {-10, 2, -1, 5}, {-2, 4, -1, 4, -1}. In this case, Kadane’s algorithm will produce the result.

Case 2: The elements which contribute to the maximum sum are arranged such that wrapping is there. Examples: {10, -12, 11}, {12, -5, 4, -8, 11}. In this case, we change wrapping to non-wrapping. Let us see how. Wrapping of contributing elements implies non wrapping of non contributing elements, so find out the sum of non contributing elements and subtract this sum from the total sum. To find out the sum of non contributing, invert sign of each element and then run Kadane’s algorithm. Our array is like a ring and we have to eliminate the maximum continuous negative that implies maximum continuous positive in the inverted arrays.

// Standard Kadane's algorithm to find maximum subarray sum

// The function returns maximum circular contiguous sum in a[]
int maxCircularSum(int a[], int n)
{
// Case 1: get the maximum sum using standard kadane's algorithm
int max_kadane = kadane(a, n);

// Case 2: Now find the maximum sum that includes
// corner elements.
int max_wrap = 0, i;
for (i=0; i<n; i++)
{
        max_wrap += a[i];     // Calculate array-sum
        a[i] = -a[i];       // invert the array (change sign)
}

// max sum with corner elements will be:
// array-sum - (-max subarray sum of inverted array)
max_wrap = max_wrap + kadane(a, n);

// The maximum circular sum will be maximum of two sums
return (max_wrap > max_kadane)? max_wrap: max_kadane;
