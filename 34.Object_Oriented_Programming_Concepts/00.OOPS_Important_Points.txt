- Some Special Functions that C++ Classes give you when you a create a class/object. 
- 4 different special fns that are always present inside a class.

1. Constructor
    - that is responsible for creating an object 
    - gets called automatically and only once.
    - same name as class name
    - Parametrised Constructor 
    - Constructor Overloading

2. Copy Constructor
    - make a copy of the given object
    - exists by default 
    - When you need define your own copy constructor?
    - Shallow Copy 
    - You have make your own copy constructor id a deep copy is needed!

3. Copy Assignment Operator =
    - Copies when you do Assignment 
    - Car d = c; //Copy Constructor
    - Car d;
      d = c; //copy assignment operator
    - you can write your own copy assignment operator to make a deep copy
    - many times.

4. Destructor
    - Clear out the memory occupied by the object 
    - automatically when the object goes out of scope
    - except for the cases when you dynamically allocated memory.

5. Const & Initialisation List
   - Const Data Members = Once Init, they cant changed their value 
   - Initialisation List = Init constant and well as other data members
   - Const Parameters = which dont get updated inside that functions 
   - Const Functions = which dont update data members of the class
