/*
You will be given an array containing only 0s, 1s and 2s. you have sort the array in linear time that is O(N) where N is the size of the array.

Input Format
The first line contains N, which is the size of the array. The following N lines contain either 0, or 1, or 2.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^6
Each input element x, such that x âˆˆ { 0, 1, 2 }.

Output Format
Output the sorted array with each element separated by a newline.

Sample Input
5
0
1
2
1
2
Sample Output
0
1
1
2
2

Logic:-
The solution to this algorithm will require 3 pointers to iterate throughout the array, swapping the necessary elements.

(1) Create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array.
(2) Create a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element.
(3) If the element at arr[mid] is a 2, then swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and decrease the high pointer by 1.
(4) If the element at arr[mid] is a 0, then swap arr[mid] and arr[low] and increase the low and mid pointers by 1.
(5) If the element at arr[mid] is a 1, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by 1.
