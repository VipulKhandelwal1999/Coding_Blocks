/*
Take the following as input.
A number
A digit
Write a function that returns the number of times digit is found in the number. Print the value returned.

Input Format
Integer (A number) Integer (A digit)

Constraints
0 <= N <= 1000000000 0 <= Digit <= 9

Output Format
Integer (count of times digit occurs in the number)

Sample Input
5433231
3
Sample Output
3
Explanation
The digit can be from 0 to 9. Assume decimal numbers.In the given case digit 3 is occurring 3 times in the given number.

Logic:-
Logic is pretty simple viz, to extract digit from the number one by one, till the number become zero and take a counter that will increment by one each time you extract a digit.

To extract digit from a number, you need to know a mathematical operation viz, modulus ( % ) that's for finding the remainder of any number when divided by a number.
If we perform modulus ( % ) of any number by 10, we get the last digit.
If the extracted digit is similar to the item provided then increment your counter by 1.
If we Divide ( / ) any number by 10, the last digit get removed form the number.
So, that next digit will be extracted from the last.

int countDigits(int n, int item){

        int cnt = 0;
        while(n != 0){

            int rem = n % 10;

            if(rem == item) cnt++;
            n = n/10;

        }

        return cnt;
    }
