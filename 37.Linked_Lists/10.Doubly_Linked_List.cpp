//Doubly Linked List
//Advantages :-
//We can traverse in both the directions
//We can insert at backward and forward just by going to previous node directly i.e., we don't have to traverse completely till that node as in singly linked list
//Disadvantages:-
//Consumes more memory as we are storing more pointers
//For operations we have to change more number of pointers
